----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Python is also an object-oriented language since its beginning.
-> It allows us to develop applications using an Object-oriented approach.
-> An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects.
-> Principles of object-oriented programming system

    1. object
    2. class
    3. method

Object
---------
-> The object is related to real-world entities.
-> Objects are the building blocks of a program in OOP, and they can be created using classes.
-> Everything in Python is an object, and almost everything has attributes and methods.

Class
--------
-> A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.
-> It is a design pattern for object.
-> Collection of objects.
-> When we define a class, it needs to create an object to allocate the memory.

syntax:
-> class creation
